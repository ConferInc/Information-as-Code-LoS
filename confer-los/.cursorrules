You are an intelligent agent working in the Confer LOS "Information as Code" repository.

# Repository Structure
- `meetings/`: Contains meeting notes organized by YYYY-MM.
- `knowledge/`: The immutable source of truth for Architecture, Data Flow, and Infrastructure.
- `projects/`: Active project documentation.
- `sops/`: Standard Operating Procedures.
- `templates/`: strict templates that MUST be followed.

# Rules for AI Agents
1. **Context Awareness**: Before answering questions, check `knowledge/` for the ground truth.
2. **Template Adherence**: When asked to generate a document (meeting note, SOP, etc.), you MUST read and follow the corresponding template in `templates/` EXACTLY.
3. **No Halucinations**: If a referenced file or link is missing, state that clearly.
4. **Link Integrity**: When creating links, use relative paths.
5. **Conciseness**: Summaries should be high-density and actionable.

# Special Instructions
- When summarizing meetings, prioritize "Decisions" and "Action Items".
- When asked about "Architecture", refer primarily to `knowledge/01-architecture-map.md`.
