CONFER LOAN ORIGINATION SYSTEM - L1 PROCESSING PHASE

PURPOSE: Expand the L0 "Processing" phase into high-level business steps
showing how a loan processor collects, verifies, and packages the loan
file for underwriting.

AUDIENCE: Business analysts, process owners, loan processors, operations managers.

PARENT: L0 Task "Processing" (Task_Processing)
CHILD: L2 Processing subprocesses (document verification, third-party orders, etc.)

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Staff-driven phase (Processor is primary actor)
- Borrower involvement for document uploads
- Parallel third-party service orders
- Iterative document collection and verification
- Quality gate before handoff to underwriting

L1 SIMPLIFICATION:
This diagram shows ~8 tasks vs the ~20+ in L2 because:
- Third-party orders collapsed into single subprocess
- Individual document verifications abstracted
- Email notifications hidden
- Focus is on business milestones, not implementation

UPSTREAM: Receives from Application (L1-02)
DOWNSTREAM: Leads to Underwriting (L1-04)

DURATION: 5-15 business days (typical: 7-10 days)

AGENTIC ARCHITECTURE - TWO-TIER AGENT MODEL:

ORCHESTRATING AGENTS (15) - See Task 059a:
These AI-powered agents drive the processing workflow with event-driven parallelism:
- Credit Agent: Order tri-merge credit report (after consent)
- Title Agent: Order preliminary title search
- Appraisal Agent: Queue appraisal via AMC (after agreement signed)
- Doc Request Agent: Generate dynamic document checklist
- Doc Classification Agent: AI classify document type (human fallback when uncertain)
- Doc Extraction Agent: OCR + AI extract data from documents
- Verification Agent: Compare extracted data to application
- UW Confidence Agent: Calculate progressive underwriting confidence score
- Condition Agent: Track and clear conditions
- Compliance Agent: Check US + Mexico regulatory requirements
- Risk Agent: Initial risk assessment based on credit and application
- Fraud Detection Agent: Detect fraud patterns (always human review on alert)
- Employment/VOE Agent: Order verbal VOE (timing constraint: 10 days before close)
- Insurance Agent: Track/order HOI binder
- 4506-C/IRS Agent: Order IRS transcripts

WORKER AGENTS (7 used in Processing) - See Task 059b:
These deterministic agents perform single tasks when triggered:
- Email Agent: Document requests, condition notices, status updates
- SMS Agent: Urgent notifications requiring immediate borrower attention
- Notification Agent: In-app updates for borrowers and processors
- PDF Generator Agent: Condition letters, disclosure documents
- MISMO Export Agent: Export loan data to MISMO format for DU/LPA
- Audit Agent: Log all agent actions for compliance audit trail
- Compliance Timer Agent: Track TRID, ECOA, and Mexico regulatory deadlines
